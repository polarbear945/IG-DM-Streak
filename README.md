# Instagram DM Streak
First, visit [this website](https://deciphertools.com/blog/how-to-export-instagram-data) to download your messages in JSON. You only need to download messages (but more is fine). Make sure to choose the time frame you want. When that information is ready, download it, extract it, and go [here](/streak_viewer.html). Then, click the upload button and choose the JSON file of the conversation you want. Navigate in the file directory until you get to a page with the folder your_instagram_activity/. When you see that go to your_instagram_activity/messages/inbox/. Here you will find a folder with all of your conversations, open the folder of the conversation you want analyzed and choose the JSON file within.
